### Python Tweet Bot for Twitter

This tweet bot utilizes multiple libraries like environ, tweepy and time to create a simple tweet bot that tweet vocabularies from a list of text. It is not used for anything else besides tweeting. This bot was then deployed through Heroku (an online cloud platform).
